Palestinian refugee agency's fuel depot in Gaza has run dry and within a few days UNRWA will no longer be able to resupply hospitals, remove sewage and provide drinking water, its chief said on Monday.UNRWA is sheltering nearly 800,000 people, or about half of the total population of Gazans who have fled their homes since an Israeli military campaign began over a month ago in response to deadly Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.The agency chief, Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, told donors on Monday that it had been slowly emptying a fuel depot on the Israeli border containing strategic reserves.A request to the Israeli military to replenish it had gone unanswered, he said.\"That reservoir is now empty,\" Lazzarini said.\"If we project out a couple of days, by the 14th of November this will severely impact ambulances and major hospital operations. Some of them (hospitals) have a bit of solar but it is marginal, so those hospitals cease functioning,\" he said.Already, many hospitals have had to close in Gaza due to war damage or lack of fuel, including al-Quds, one of the major hospitals in the north of Gaza that has been the focus of Israel's ground invasion.Israel's military has so far refused imports of fuel into Gaza, saying they could be diverted to Hamas for military purposes.UNRWA's fuel is also used to remove hundreds of tonnes of solid waste from increasingly overcrowded camps in southern Gaza, and Lazzarini said these services would soon halt.Without fuel, desalination plants in the narrow, densely populated coastal strip used to provide drinking water to support at least 290,000 people will also stop on Nov. 15, he added.\"So the situation is very dire now and it's about to get much worse,\" Lazzarini told donors.(Reporting by Emma Farge; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

        "text": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom WestbrookAn era has drawn to a close with the death of Charlie Munger, a month short of his 100th birthday.The union of Munger and Warren Buffett is among the most successful in the history of business, transforming Berkshire Hathaway into a multi-billion dollar conglomerate.Often handy with a one-liner Munger summed up his fame in 2010: \"I think part of the popularity of Berkshire Hathaway is that we look like people who have found a trick,\" he said.\"It's not brilliance. It's just avoiding stupidity.\"Buffet noted \"Charlie's inspiration (and) wisdom\" in a statement.Investors in Asia, meanwhile, took comments from erstwhile Federal Reserve hawk Christopher Waller as perhaps a signal of another era-shift, as he flagged that U.S. interest rates could be cut in the months ahead.A rally in bonds and slide in the dollar that has run for weeks in the afterglow of a benign U.S. inflation report extended in Asia in the wake of Waller's remarks.Two-year Treasury yields fell to a four-month low just below 4.70%. Ten-year Treasury yields hit a two-month low of 4.28%.Interest rate futures price more than 100 basis points of cuts next year and a 40% chance they begin as soon a March.The dollar's slide led to multi-month highs for the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc against the greenback and sent spot gold, in dollars, to its highest since May.German inflation data and Eurozone confidence surveys are the next major economic calendar items for traders to watch.In the Asia session Australian inflation came in below expectations, while New Zealand's central bank surprised investors with a warning that rate hikes may not be finished if price pressures do not ease.China's stockmarkets also stood out.With cheer that U.S. interest rates have peaked spreading across global markets, the MSCI index of world stocks is up 8.8% in November and heading for its largest monthly percentage gain in three years.Chinese blue chips by contrast are down more than 2% this month and set for a fourth straight monthly drop.

He\u2019s starting another company! Wait, the OpenAI board wants him back! No, it doesn\u2019t! Microsoft (MSFT) is hiring him! OpenAI employees are revolting!It\u2019s got everything \u2014 big personalities; big companies; dramatic, fast-moving developments; and a technology that\u2019s been both a buzzword and a driver of returns this year.But the story also has real repercussions for investors and anyone who will be affected by artificial intelligence \u2014 that is, pretty much everyone.First, let\u2019s take the implications for investors, particularly those who hold Microsoft shares. As my colleague Josh Schafer outlined, many analysts are cheering CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s move to bring Sam Altman fully into the fold after forging a relationship with him, both personal and financial. That\u2019s reflected in Monday\u2019s bounce in Microsoft shares, which initially fell on Friday on the news that Altman was departing OpenAI, in which Microsoft had invested.This could potentially solidify what some see as Microsoft\u2019s lead in AI. Through its collaboration with OpenAI, it has incorporated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine and other products. Now, by directly hiring Altman and one of his co-founders, Greg Brockman, \u201cMr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI \u2014 its ambitious talent,\u201d wrote Macquarie analyst Frederick Havemeyer in a note to investors.That could potentially leave some of Microsoft\u2019s competitors in AI \u2013 particularly the likes of Alphabet and Meta \u2013 on the back foot.On the other hand, they too could hire some of the OpenAI workers. (As of this writing, more than two-thirds of OpenAI\u2019s employees had reportedly threatened to resign.) There\u2019s also the wrinkle that Microsoft owns 49% of OpenAI, which is now in disarray, though Semafor has reported that it hasn\u2019t yet wired the company its full investment.So the stakes are high for Microsoft and its peers.The much bigger question is what this means for the development of AI \u2014 a technology that this year has been touted as having the ability to change the way we work and live.Reportedly, one of the points of contention between Altman and members of the board was how quickly to develop and commercialize new, AI-based technologies while still not posing a threat to humanity. That threat has been flagged by everyone from one of the \u201cgodfathers of AI\u201d to Elon Musk to Sam Altman himself, along with a who\u2019s who of AI luminaries.Now that Altman is under the purview of a public company whose job is explicitly to make money for shareholders versus the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, whose \u201cprincipal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors,\u201d will he be more likely to brush aside those potential threats? Or was the mission statement a fig leaf anyway?Will this newsletter be written by our AI overlords a year or five years from now as a result of this pivotal decision by OpenAI to fire Sam Altman, setting off a chain of events that will lead him to prioritize profit over prudence and lead to humanity\u2019s downfall?Probably not. But it still reminds us of a specter hovering over all of this AI hype \u2014 the power over this technology with the huge potential to shape our futures is concentrated in just a few hands.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

High-interest rates have hit demand for EVs, and auto manufacturers, led by the world's most valuable automaker Tesla, have responded by cutting prices.The Elon Musk-led automaker has cut sticker prices multiple times this year to fend off new lower priced electric vehicles from eating into its depleting market share.The EV price war has forced companies to prioritize sales over margins and has brought down the average price of EVs to $50,683 in September, a report by Cox Automotive showed.Lucid slashed the price of its Air Touring model to $87,500 from $95,000 and the more powerful Grand Touring by $10,000 to $115,600.The Newark, California-based company also slashed the price of its all-wheel drive Air Pure to $74,900 from $82,400. The price of its latest offering, the rear-wheel drive Air Pure, remains unchanged at $77,400.Tesla has cut the prices of its Model S premium sedan, Lucid Air's closest competitor, to $74,990.Lucid had previously cut prices for its cars in August as the company burned through cash as it ramped up production in a tough economy.However, backing from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has given the company, which is set to report its third-quarter results on Tuesday, a liquidity boost over some of its other cash-crunched peers.The price cut offer will be valid till Nov 30, the company said.(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)",

        "text": "By Ahmad GhaddarLONDON (Reuters) -An OPEC technical panel invited a top financial market dealer to give a presentation this week which painted a bearish outlook for the oil market, according to materials from the presentation seen by Reuters.\"Market sentiment had been fragmented for much of this year, but the evidence is that there has been a recent shift in collective sentiment to bearish as we head towards the end of the calendar year,\" one of the presentation slides by Onyx Capital Group showed.OPEC - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - did not immediately reply to a request for comment.London-based Onyx Capital Group is the world's biggest market maker by volume across oil swaps, trading more than 25 billion barrels equivalent a year. It says it owns a dataset that analyses market positions to predict how the market behaves.Onyx CEO Greg Newman gave the presentation, according to a company tweet on X, formerly Twitter. Its content was not made public, however.According to the materials seen by Reuters, it also showed that Brent futures had undergone two significant sell-offs since the start of the quarter, with the first, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 2, driven by weak U.S. gasoline markets and financial speculators.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdelaziz bin Salman, OPEC's most influential minister, famously warned financial speculators against betting heavily in the oil market in 2020, challenging those looking to short the market to \"make my day\".The second sell-off, which happened in November, moved the oil market to a collective neutral-to-bearish sentiment, with commercial participants like oil producers and airlines joining financial speculators in seeing a weak outlook.\"The second aggressive moves were correlated with a weakening forward outlook for underlying crude and refined products market,\" Onyx said in the presentation materials.It added that the oil market forward curve signalled the market expects supply of heavy crude, which several OPEC members produce, will likely come back next year, and inventories will start to rebuild.The Economic Commission Board (ECB), which OPEC describes as its \"think-tank\", meets twice a year ahead of the ordinary ministerial OPEC conference to review market conditions and economic developments.While it has no decision-making capacity, the research it produces is important for ministers that will eventually decide on output policy.Ministers from OPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, are due to meet on Sunday to decide on output policy.The group is likely to discuss output cuts to shore up falling oil prices, which are down more than 13% since the start of this quarter.Goldman Sachs this week said it expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their voluntary oil production cuts into the first quarter 2024.It also sees a 35% possibility the group will deepen production cuts, potentially through another 0.5-1 million barrel per day reduction shared among the large producers, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.The ECB on Tuesday also heard presentations from banks JPMorgan and BNP Paribas, three sources told Reuters. It will meet for a second day on Wednesday.(Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Jan Harvey)",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s call for mass deregulation of the cryptocurrency industry and drastic cuts to the Securities and Exchange Commission are the makings of crypto regulators\u2019 nightmares, yet a version of that plan could be a reality if a Republican wins the White House.Most Read from BloombergAltman Returns as OpenAI CEO in Chaotic Win for MicrosoftMcKinsey and Its Peers Are Facing the Wildest Headwinds in YearsHulu for $1, Max for $3: Streaming Services Slash Prices This Black FridayOpenAI Engineers Earning $800,000 a Year Turn Rare Skillset Into LeverageDutch Far-Right Leader Wilders Scores Shock Election VictoryRamaswamy \u2014 who is polling in the single digits \u2014 is unlikely to become the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, but he has echoed many policy positions of frontrunner Donald Trump, teeing himself up for a potential high-profile spot in a GOP administration that could have significant sway over crypto.Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal would eliminate many of the few crypto regulations in effect and cut the SEC and other regulatory agencies\u2019 workforces by 75%. That has raised alarms in the industry, particularly given its proximity to the criminal conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried following the implosion of his trading platform FTX and guilty pleas announced Tuesday from crypto exchange Binance Holdings Ltd. and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, on anti-money laundering and US sanctions violations charges.The series of high-profile crypto misdeeds has prompted congressional lawmakers to pursue more oversight of the industry to protect consumers, making Ramaswamy out of step with members of both parties and many inside the industry who want a baseline of regulations to help legitimize the technology which has been subject to a wave of bad headlines over the past year.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a ton of regulation now,\u201d said Howard Fischer, a partner at Moses Singer and former SEC lawyer. \u201cThere is a perception of significant risk, and if there is no regulation whatsoever, I think that that\u2019s going to lead a lot of investors and participants to shy away from the space.\u201dThe 2024 election is the first presidential race where crypto has been treated as a serious policy issue, and Ramaswamy is the first Republican candidate to release a plan regarding the currency.\u201cThe recent examples of large-scale fraud (e.g. FTX) reveal that the status quo is at once insufficient to protect ordinary investors, while also impeding innovation,\u201d Ramaswamy said in a statement. \u201cThe policy principles that I announced \u2013 freedom to code, freedom to financial self-reliance, and freedom from regulatory overreach \u2013 are the first step toward a broader regulatory framework for digital assets.\u201dHis campaign has financial backing from some in the crypto industry, including Gemini exchange co-founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm Operations LP and Coinbase Global Inc., Bitgo co-founder Michael Belshe and Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith also donated.Ramaswamy calls for a series of changes, including prohibiting federal agencies from creating restrictions on crypto wallets and clarifying that the Bank Secrecy Act does not govern blockchain infrastructure providers. These changes would likely involve input from Capitol Hill, meaning his plan can\u2019t become law without the approval of lawmakers.\u201cThis is not something that the executive branch can just do,\u201d said Reena Aggarwal, director of the Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy at the Georgetown School of Business. \u201cCongress would be involved in a big way, so it\u2019s not reality.\u201dThose looking to influence a second Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda are also looking to curb crypto regulation. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a comprehensive look at how a Republican White House should view policy, calls to shift crypto regulation away from the SEC and into the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency that the industry believes to be more crypto-friendly.Peter St Onge, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, said Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal aligns with his employer\u2019s view of the SEC, which he believes does not adequately fight fraud.\u201cThey either become captured by the industries that they\u2019re supposed to be policing, particularly salient in finance, or they justify their existence by creating these burdens that end up hurting the overall market,\u201d he said.Congress has begun to contemplate a more comprehensive framework for crypto assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, have sponsored a bill viewed as taking an industry-friendly approach, and that Lummis has said \u201cappropriately balances consumer protections while allowing innovation to thrive.\u201d\u201cThe crypto asset industry desperately needs clear rules of the road to protect consumers while encouraging innovation,\u201d Lummis said in a statement. \u201cEliminating the few protections we currently have instead of installing additional consumer-focused guardrails would be a grave misstep.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has contemplated a more restrictive approach that would crack down on digital asset use, drawing connections to money laundering and sanctions evasion.The SEC declined to comment on Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal.Voters themselves are also hesitant to let crypto exist rules-free. An April Pew survey found 75% of Americans who have heard of crypto are not confident in its safety and reliability.\u201cWith the American people, crypto is toxic,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of nonprofit Better Markets who previously served on President Joe Biden\u2019s transition team working with financial regulation. \u201cAmerican investors and customers have lost trillions of dollars in crypto over the last couple of years.\u201d--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud and Bill Allison.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit HoleThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable PhaseMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at ThanksgivingX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic PostsGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

That reduction comes alongside the much-anticipated extension into next year of Saudi Arabia\u2019s voluntary output curb of the same size.Members have an agreement principle that will now go to a vote, delegates said, asking not the be named because the information was private. Final details of the accord, including national production levels, will be announced individually by each country rather than in the customary OPEC+ communique, they said.Oil traders were unimpressed with the lack of detail. WTI erased initial gains to sink 3.4% to $75.31 a barrel as of 11:30 a.m. in New York.The additional 1 million barrel-a-day cut fulfills what delegates had said was Riyadh\u2019s main goal for the meeting. More than a week of preparatory talks appeared to have overcome internal disagreements over some African nations\u2019 production quotas, which had forced the video conference to be pushed back by several days.\u201cIf those numbers get confirmed it shows OPEC+ wants to keep their hands on the oil wheel,\u201d said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG. The alliance is \u201ccontinuing to apply a proactive stance considering likely seasonally weaker demand at the start of 2024.\u201dSince July, Saudi Arabia has been making an extra voluntary cut of 1 million barrels a day, described by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as a \u201clollipop.\u201d The kingdom was pressing the rest of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to join this effort after crude prices fell by more than 10% from their September high. A deeper collective reduction could stave off a renewed oil surplus predicted for early next year.\u201cThe Saudi \u2018lollipop\u2019 has been successfully socialized into an \u2018OPEC+ lollipop\u2019,\u201d said Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., who was one of the first analysts to predict a deeper cut. \u201cIf there is anything that proves the cohesion of OPEC+ it\u2019s surely this decision today.\u201dA new group-wide OPEC+ cut of 1 million barrels a day could actually be only half as big in real terms, Amrita Sen, director of research at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd., told Bloomberg television before the meeting. That\u2019s because some countries are already pumping below their targets, she said.Key details on the cuts are still missing, Staunovo said. It was not immediately clear how the cuts would be distributed between members, nor how Russia\u2019s 300,000 barrel-a-day export cut would factor into the new totals.The outlook for oil has weakened over the past two months amid plentiful supplies and a darkening economic backdrop. Price could fall even further next year, when forecasters including the International Energy Agency anticipate a sharp slowdown in demand growth.In a surprise move, Brazil will join the cooperation charter of the OPEC+ oil alliance, a move that won\u2019t bind it to making production cuts. Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira told a meeting of the group on Thursday that the country would make the move next year. The charter, open to all oil producing countries, doesn\u2019t bind signatories or limit their sovereign rights.\u201cPresident Lula confirmed our entry into the OPEC+ cooperation charter from January 2024,\u201d the minister told the group, according to a video circulated by delegates.

The rebound has also brought the S&P 500 within a very close range of its 2023 intra-day high.\"The (Fed) comments are refocusing investors on the idea that the inflation rate is coming down and as the inflation rate comes down, they're hopeful that it'll bring rates down, and ultimately bring the market higher,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.Board Governor Michelle Bowman, on the other hand, indicated that the central bank will likely need to further raise borrowing costs to bring inflation down to its 2% target, keeping further gains in check.Personal consumption expenditure data - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - and the \"Beige Book\", a snapshot of the U.S. economy, which are due later this week, will likely show how the economy is faring under tighter monetary conditions.At 11:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 174.29 points, or 0.49%, at 35,507.76, the S&P 500 was up 16.54 points, or 0.36%, at 4,566.97, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 59.27 points, or 0.42%, at 14,300.29.Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were in the green, with utility stocks up 0.8% and leading gains.Data showing a rise in U.S. consumer confidence in November after three straight monthly declines also helped lift the market sentiment.Among single stocks, Boeing added 2.3% after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the aerospace company to \"outperform\" from \"sector perform\" and set a Street-high price target.U.S.-listed shares of PDD Holdings jumped 17.6% after the Chinese e-commerce firm beat third-quarter revenue estimates.Affirm Holdings added 5.9%, extending its gains from Monday, as Jefferies upgraded the payments platform and data showed more price-conscious shoppers had turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) services during Cyber Monday.Meanwhile, Micron Technology shares fell 2.4% after the chip firm said it expects first-quarter operating expenses to be higher than its prior estimates.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded 19 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 new highs and 81 new lows.(Reporting by Shristi Achar A and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Peru\u2019s congress over the last seven years has become notorious for its unchecked powers to impeach presidents, putting the nation under seven different leaders in that time while undercutting growth in what had been one of the region\u2019s standout economies.Most Read from BloombergAston Martin Owner Lawrence Stroll Sells F1 Team Stake at \u00a31 Billion ValuationHamas Mastermind Who Tricked Israel Is Top Target in Gaza TunnelsApple Plans to Make It Easier to Text Between iPhones and AndroidsApple\u2019s Effort to Replace Qualcomm Chip in iPhone Falls Further Behind\u2018Fed-Friendly\u2019 Data Lift Bonds as S&P 500 Wavers: Markets WrapBut on Thursday, congress took an initial surprise step to curtail those powers that could improve governance by passing legislation to create a second chamber of congress, diluting the powers of a parliament that currently only has one chamber.The vote by a super majority of 93 of 130 lawmakers will allow them to push this reform through if they can muster a super majority in a second vote next year. Had lawmakers obtained only a simple majority, they would have had to put the measure to a national referendum. The news came as a shock to most Peruvians given congress\u2019s failure to keep the public informed and in the loop.A broad consensus of Peru watchers agree that the country\u2019s current single-chamber congress has created significant problems for its democracy. The extreme political volatility triggered by the cycle of impeachments has taken a toll on Peru\u2019s economy, once among the fastest-growing in Latin America, which this year fell into a recession.Read More: Impeachment Mania Unravels an Economic Miracle in Latin America\u201cI think that in theory this is a good reform, the issue is that congress has a legitimacy problem,\u201d said Gonzalo Banda, a Peruvian political analyst. \u201cIn any decent country, a reform like this would have had public discussions to address the pros and cons, but not in Peru.\u201dIn 2018, 91% of Peruvians in a referendum rejected the proposed creation of a Senate. But the move also faces questions of motivation. In the same referendum, Peruvians voted against allowing for the reelection of lawmakers, but the new bill passed Thursday would not place term-limits on senators.Congressional HistoryPeru has had two chambers of congress for most of its history. But it was President Alberto Fujimori who in 1992 illegally dissolved congress and then streamlined it into one chamber, after rewriting the constitution.This newer structure has long been criticized by political scientists, who argue that a single chamber can have too much power and face too little scrutiny. For example, impeaching a president requires a single vote in congress and the whole process can be carried out in less than a week.The result has given congress great power and has made it deeply unpopular. An Ipsos poll this month found congress only has an 11% approval rating, just slightly better than Boluarte\u2019s 10% approval rating.The vote \u201cIs a first step towards strengthening the institutional framework. Should be positive for the market,\u201d said Gonzalo Navarro, a currency strategist with bank BBVA in an email to clients.But even political scientists who support the move, have been skeptical that congress will be able to push it through.\u201cA congress with an approval rating this low does not have enough legitimacy to approve constitutional changes this important,\u201d said Fernando Tuesta, a professor of political science at Peru\u2019s Pontifical Catholic University who also headed the committee that proposed the failed referendum to create the senate back in 2018.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San FranciscoWhy America\u2019s Wind Power Failures Are Good for GEThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on XAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for VibesPeter Thiel Is Still Hoping That Donald Trump Just Fades Away\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Pfizer's shares fell 1.7% after the drugmaker reported its first quarterly loss since 2019.\"Earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter are coming down,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. \"A lot of that has to do with the guidance that's coming from S&P 500 companies, which has been more conservative.\"Fourth-quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies as of Friday has fallen to 8.5% from 11.0% expected on Oct. 1, according to LSEG data.Meanwhile, investors are waiting to see what the Fed says after a two-day policy meeting ends on Wednesday, which is unlikely to deter significantly from past statements.\"It's going to be the same dry higher for longer message that the markets continue to struggle with,\" Saglimbene said.MSCI's U.S.-centric gauge of stocks across the globe slipped 0.07%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.59%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, the S&P 500 gained 0.04% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.2%.The yen fell about 1.5% to a new one-year low of 151.32 after the BOJ eased its grip on long-term rates by further loosening its bond yield control policy (YCC) on what analysts viewed as a small and insufficient step.The yen fell as traders focused on the BOJ's dovish pledge to \"patiently\" maintain accommodative policy, and forecast inflation to slow below 2% in 2025.The yen also weakened further against the euro, with the single currency up 1.5% to a 15-year high of 160.64.Longer-dated Treasury yields dipped as investors awaited the Fed statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Benchmark 10-year notes last week hit 16-year highs as investors contemplate higher yields for longer, and on concerns about increasing U.S. Treasury supply.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 2.5 basis points to 4.852%.Euro zone yields fell as individual country inflation data pointed to a lower print for the currency bloc overall later in the day. Germany's benchmark 10-year yield fell 5.5 basis points to 2.77%, testing the previous day's two-week low.Asian equities earlier slid as Chinese manufacturing activity returned to contraction, reviving worries over the world's second-largest economy. Recent indicators had showed a nascent recovery in China.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, gained 0.48%. The euro looked set to reverse two straight months of losses with a 0.3% gain for October.The single currency was last up 0.3% at $1.0662.Oil prices were steady on Tuesday as a drop in euro zone inflation was balanced by higher OPEC output.U.S. crude recently fell 0.06% to $82.26 per barrel and Brent was at $87.65, up 0.23% on the day.(Reporting by Tom Wilson in London and Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Kim Coghill, Miral Fahmy, Jan Harvey and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

He declined to disclose the specific licence the company might seek.\"As the Chinese capital market continues to grow beyond simple stock trading and into more complex products, the concept of market making not only will come naturally but also becomes necessary instead of just adding value from a liquidity perspective,\" Zhao said.Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Securities, which handles about $390 billion in trades per day, is one of the top market makers by trading volume in the United States.Market makers quote both buy and sell prices for assets and are constant trading participants in the market, earning profit through the spread of bid and offer prices.China's nascent market-making sector could grow to be worth 250 billion yuan ($34 billion) in revenues in 2032, compared with an estimated 40 billion yuan last year, according to Chinese brokerage Haitong.Market-making was first introduced in China in 2014. In February, Beijing started to allow licenced securities brokerage firms to act as market makers for its newest board Beijing Stock Exchange, following a similar move in May 2022 for its Nasdaq-style STAR Market.Citadel Securities in July appointed Tony Tang, the former head of BlackRock's China business, to helm its China operations.In February, it became a \"qualified foreign institutional investor\" in China, a few months after the country allowed qualified foreign institutions to trade more broadly in domestic futures and options instruments.The wider access it gained with that licence covers bonds, futures and options in addition to stocks it traded via China's Stock Connect Programme.This year, Citadel Securities also launched an investment-grade corporate bond market-making business in the United States. It is now looking to bring that business to Asia. Currently, it focuses on helping clients in Asia trade in U.S. assets such as U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollar interest rate swaps.Since 2020, the brokerage has more than doubled its Asia Pacific headcount to nearly 300 people, a contrast to the wider trend of Wall Street layoffs amid depressed deal activity due to high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty.(Reporting by Summer Zhen and Selena Li in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Edwina Gibbs)",

CherneyNov 30 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Marvell Technology said on Thursday it expects its data center business to continue to grow next year even as roughly half its revenue will decline in the first quarter as its customers face tough conditions.Its shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading.CEO Matthew Murphy attributed the anticipated drop in revenue from its segments including wireless carrier infrastructure and enterprise to a tough macroeconomic environment and longer-than-expected inventory corrections by its customers.\"You've seen it in announcements from the big enterprise companies and you've also seen it from the carrier companies,\" Murphy said in an interview with Reuters. \"It's a very weak environment.\"The data center segment, which includes its custom AI chip business and networking equipment, beat market expectations for revenue in the third quarter of 2024. Murphy said he expects the segment to continue to grow but that it's difficult to predict how that will fare next year largely because of AI.\"The real swing is the AI portion - in terms of how it's going to grow, what's the magnitude of it,\" Murphy said. \"It's gone up so much this year.\"Marvell helps companies such as Amazon.com's cloud computing unit build custom chips.For the company's enterprise and carrier business, inventory clearing has dampened prospects of new orders for chip makers like Marvell.Murphy said on an earnings call that while Marvell does expect year-on-year growth going forward, he could not comment on concerns surrounding inventory build hindering growth projections for the first quarter.The company's fourth-quarter forecast came in below Wall Street estimates.For the current quarter, Marvell expects revenue of $1.42 billion plus or minus 5%, compared with estimates of $1.46 billion.On an adjusted basis, the company expects income of 46 cents per share, plus or minus 5 cents for the fourth quarter. This compares to estimates of 49 cents profit per share.However, Marvell beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, as the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) buoyed demand for its chips.Marvell posted net revenue of $1.42 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 28, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.40 billion, according to LSEG data.Excluding items, the company posted a profit of 41 cents per share, marginally beating estimates of 40 cents per share.

        "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Thousands of hotel workers fighting for new union contracts rallied on the Las Vegas Strip on Wednesday evening, halting rush-hour traffic before dozens were arrested for sitting in the street. The stepped-up labor unrest aimed to draw attention to negotiations with three major casino companies.Seated in two separate circles, workers in red T-shirts blocked cars in both directions for roughly 30 minutes as the sun sank in the west, casting golden rays across one of the most recognizable stretches of the Strip near the Bellagio fountain, the Eiffel Tower replica and Caesars Palace. Police officers with zip ties eventually started taking protesters into custody, leading them to a white police bus with flashing red and blue lights.Las Vegas police said 58 people were cited for assembling to disturb the peace, a misdemeanor.\u201cThe event was peaceful,\u201d Lt. Mark Lourenco said via text message.The Culinary Workers Union overwhelmingly voted last month to authorize a strike if they don\u2019t soon reach agreements with MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.The companies did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday.It also comes at the same time casino workers in Michigan, including employees of the MGM Grand Detroit, are on strike.Leaders of the Culinary Workers Union said they wanted a show of force ahead of any potential strike.As the protest began, Kimberly Dopler, a cocktail server at Wynn Las Vegas since it opened in 2005, said she planned to halt traffic.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the companies will listen to us and realize that we\u2019re not joking. We\u2019re ready to walk out,\u201d she said.Two visitors from Missouri, Cindy Hiatt and Michelle Shirley, watched as the rally began. They said they won\u2019t return to Las Vegas again during any potential strike by hotel workers.\u201cThe hotels are going to have to realize that they\u2019re not going to have people wanting to come to Vegas without these workers,\u201d Hiatt said.A Las Vegas strike deadline has not yet been set as the union and casino companies return to the bargaining table this week. But Ted Pappageorge, the union\u2019s secretary and treasurer, told reporters this month that thousands of workers who keep the Strip\u2019s hotel-casinos humming could walk off the job in the coming weeks if the latest round of negotiations aren\u2019t productive.The culinary union is the largest labor union in Nevada with about 60,000 members. Contracts for about 40,000 of them in Las Vegas expired recently, and negotiations have been underway for months over topics such as pay and working conditions.Bethany Khan, the union\u2019s spokesperson, said in an interview after the protest that the union will cover all legal fees for the workers who were arrested, including bail and any costs for legal representation in court.Kahn said all union members currently receive health insurance and earn about $26 hourly, including benefits. She declined to say how much the union is seeking in pay raises because \u201cwe do not negotiate in public,\u201d although the union has said it is asking for \u201cthe largest wage increases ever negotiated\u201d in its history.The union hasn\u2019t gone on strike in more than three decades. A walkout would be the latest in a series of high-profile job actions around the country, including walkouts in Hollywood and the auto production lines in Detroit.Leslie Lilla, a cocktail server at the Bellagio for 25 years, said earlier this month that union members have been preparing for a possible strike and are ready and willing to walk off the job.\u201cWe\u2019re ready to show our company by our feet, and that means walking ourselves right out of the building,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been saving and we\u2019ve been putting money into our accounts.\u201d____Associated Press writer Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.",

It was one of the most promising startups of 2018, counting among its early investors some partners of his former employers, including TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and Silver Lake Management LLC.Trikon\u2019s hedge fund was up 2.9% this year through August, bettering the flat return of a Eurekahedge gauge tracking Asia-Pacific funds that bet on rising and falling stocks.

They also carried out search and seizure warrants in Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Minas Gerais states. The police statement did not mention Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group in Lebanon.Hezbollah could not immediately be reached for comment.\"The Federal Police is carrying out an investigation based on the hypothesis of a terrorist network that was trying to install itself in Brazil,\" Justice Minister Flavio Dino said at an event in Rio de Janeiro.Jewish leaders told Reuters last month that they had noticed a rise in antisemitic discourse online, amid a broader global surge in antisemitism since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel and subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military.\"We're following with apprehension and concern this Federal Police operation today. Brazil doesn't have a history of terrorism and we hope that the conflict in the Middle East isn't imported over to here,\" said Ricardo Berkiensztat, executive president of the Jewish Federation of the State of Sao Paulo (Fisesp).Hezbollah was set up by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon. The heavily armed powerful group has seats in parliament and government and acts as Iran's spearhead in Lebanon and the region.Since the Oct. 7 attack, Hezbollah has been engaging Israeli forces along the border, in the deadliest escalation since it fought a war with Israel in 2006.Hezbollah has been designated a terrorist organization by Argentina, Britain, Canada, Germany, Honduras and the United States, as well as most U.S.-allied Gulf states. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said in 2019 he planned to also label Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the move never took place.(Additional reporting by Steven Grattan, Gabriel Stargardter and Lisandra Paraguassu Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",

        "text": "*Siemens Energy gets 12 bln euro guarantee line from banks*Government provides counter guarantee to banks*Siemens AG shares +2.75%, Siemens Energy shares +2.95%(Adds details from sources, updates shares)By Christian Kraemer and Alexander H\u00fcbnerBERLIN/MUNICH, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The German government on Tuesday said it had decided to backstop Siemens Energy with guarantees worth 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) as part of a deal with other stakeholders to help the troubled energy company fulfil its order book.Deepening problems at the firm's wind turbine unit Siemens Gamesa and a subsequent move by S&P to cut the group's long-term credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above junk, during the summer had made banks more reluctant to provide guarantees.Siemens Energy in October disclosed talks with the government, banks and former parent Siemens AG over what sources said were guarantees for project and warranty bonds needed to safeguard the firm's 109 billion euro order book.\"The group has a problem as a result of the takeover of the Spanish company Gamesa, faulty wind turbines, which in turn has put the company, which is otherwise in good health and has full order books, in a precarious situation,\" Economy Minister Robert Habeck said.Berlin's decision to step in reflects its view of Siemens Energy, which makes gas and wind turbines as well as large converter states, as a maker of vital equipment for the country's transition away from polluting fossil fuels.The guarantees are part of a package totalling 15 billion euros agreed with private banks and other stakeholders and would also impose a pause on dividends and higher level bonuses at Siemens Energy, the economy ministry said in a statement.Private banks were expected to provide Siemens Energy with guarantees worth 12 billion euros while Siemens Energy would seek another 3 billion from other sources, the statement said, adding it was conditional on the final sign-off of all parties.The 3 billion euros in guarantees will likely come from international stakeholders such as Denmark and Spain, where Siemens Energy has a significant presence, two people familiar with the matter said.GUARANTEES, NOT CASHThe government will provide the 7.5 billion euros as a counter guarantee to the private banks in order for them to come through, the statement said.\"We are pleased with the German government's clear support for Siemens Energy and the commitment to the rapid implementation of projects to make the energy transition a success,\" Siemens Energy said in a statement.\"We will provide further details at our annual press conference on November 15.\"In a separate statement, Siemens AG said it had been working to find a solution and would share further details at a later stage.Shares in Siemens AG and Siemens Energy closed up 2.75% and 2.95%, respectively, following the news.Reuters first reported last week that all stakeholders had reached an agreement in principle to cover the guarantees, helping the group's shares to recover after news of the discussions pushed the stock to a record low last month.Siemens AG, which spun off Siemens Energy in 2020, is also expected to provide support by buying most of the 24% stake Siemens Energy owns in Siemens Ltd, an Indian joint venture, sources have told Reuters.Siemens AG will pay more than 2 billion euros for around 18% of Siemens Ltd, which would bring its own stake in the joint venture to around 70%, the sources said.Justice Minister Marco Buschmann had defended the deal ahead of the announcement.\"It's not about the state somehow saving a company without a business model, a broken company,\" said Buschmann in an interview with RTL and ntv. He stressed the deal did not involve subsidies. \"It's not about cash, it's about guarantees.\"($1 = 0.9240 euros) (Reporting by Christian Kraemer, Riham Alkousaa, Markus Wacket, Andreas Rinke, Alexander H\u00fcbner, Christoph Steitz and Linda Pasquini; Writing by Madeline Chambers and Matthias Williams; Editing by Kirsti Knolle and David Evans)",
